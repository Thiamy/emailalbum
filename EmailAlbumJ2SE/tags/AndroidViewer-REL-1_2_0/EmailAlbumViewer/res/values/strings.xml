	<string name="app_name">EmailAlbum Viewer</string>
	<string name="no_file">Welcome to EmailAlbum Viewer.\n
	\n
	The main purpose of this application is to present you a slideshow from archive
	files containing pictures that you might receive in your Gmail Inbox.\n
	\n
	So, most of the time, you don\'t have to launch this app, Gmail will open it
	himself when you ask him to view a .zip or a .jar archive that you received
	attached in an e-mail.\n
	\n
	You might still want to launch EmailAlbum alone if you want to browse files
	located on your device filesystem (sdcard). If this is what you want to do now, you just
	have to hit the Menu button and select \'Open an album\'.\n
	\n
	* This app was first developed to allow users of EmailAlbum to view their
	slideshows on Android devices.
	EmailAlbum is an opensource ultra-light de slideshow generator. These slideshows are compact
	enough to be sent by mail and can be run on any computer with Java SE installed (Windows, Mac, Linux...).\n
