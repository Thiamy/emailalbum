=Step by step EmailAlbum How-to.=

You must have a Java JRE v1.4.2 or higher (Java 6 is recommended for better performance) installed on your computer : http://www.java.com/

Download [http://emailalbum.googlecode.com/files/emailalbum-1.0.1.jar EmailAlbum] and execute it. With Windows and a correct Java version, double-clicking it is enough to execute it.

For other Operating Systems, or if double-clicking it fails, run the command line :
{{{
java -jar emailalbum-1.0.1.jar
}}}

The main EmailAlbum window opens. It is a file selector allowing to select JPEG pictures.
